    Running For Curious People
    <div class="lead">by <b>Hildeberto Mendonca</b></div>
  </h1>
  <br>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-9">
      <p>I started running in 2017, when I was 38 years old. Since then, I have made too many mistakes that led to many injuries. Most of the time, I ran by my own rules, with minimal guidance from a running group and watching YouTube videos. I was in a &quot;No pain no gain&quot; mode, but common sense didn't seem to make sense. It affected my consistency and got me stuck below average for 4 years.</p>
<p>Then, one day, I learned that running is surpringly counter-intuitive. The change started when I read the book &quot;Born to Run&quot; by <a href="https://www.chrismcdougall.com">Christopher McDougall</a>. That was the first time I heard about running form, ultra-running, and how we evolved to run. Running form is the way the body positions itself to run optimally. It is also what we lose between our time as a kid, running everywhere all the time, and adulthood when we only have time to study and work. Ultra-running is any distance higher than a marathon, but before the marathon was created, ultra-running was almost every run, since we ran to survive, hunting animals for hours. Million years before agriculture was introduced, humankind was running for food, so our bodies adapted to do it with excellence.</p>
<p>Finishing &quot;Born to Run&quot; expanded my interest in reading more and basing my knowledge around running literature. Books have many references and it is hard to write one, so I appreciate the effort authors put into getting them published. They certainly went through extensive research and rounds of revision from other experts.</p>
<p>The more I read the better I enjoyed running. I got curious about how my body works, how strength and endurance are built, the mechanics of movement and breathing, and the dynamics of nutrition and hydration. All these subjects have measurements that produce numbers, which enable calculations to discover ranges, patterns, and limits. Not everybody likes to know all these details, but geeks do.</p>
<p>Geek Runners is for those who want to run or already run and are curious about the details of running. They may have a coach, an app, or something printed from the Internet, but they want to understand why the program is designed that way, why today is a long and slow run and two days later it is an excruciating 8 x 800m fast. It is not just about doing what we are told to do, but understanding what and why we are doing in terms of movement, effort, hydration, nutrition, elevation, and so many other variables.</p>
<p>In addition to knowledge, Geek Runners also make libraries, tools, and services available for the running community. It's a work in progress, but at this point, we are already offering an <a href="https://github.com/geekrunners/librunner">open-source programming library</a> for those geeks who want to understand and contribute to running data processing, as well as using it to build their tools and services.</p>
